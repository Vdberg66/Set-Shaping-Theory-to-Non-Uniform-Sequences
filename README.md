If you want to use the algorithm for sources with different distributions, please contact us. We are able to create versions that work for any type of non-uniform function.

If you don't have Matlab, you can sign up and request the free trial version for one month. In order to use the program you have to add the following toolboxes (open matlab and click on Add-Ons):

Signal processing toolbox

DSP system toolbox

Communication toolbox

Registration and installation are very fast, so anyone can test the program in a short time.

In order to understand the set Shaping Theory, we suggest to read the following presentation:

We are grateful to Professor John Kendall Dixon for sharing these presentations.
